# Electronic_PIC18F458
This an electronics group project from my second year in University. 

The project is about interfacing an LM35 temperature reading module with a microcontroller(PIC 18F458).

We had to do the whole project from scratch:
  - Designing the circuit schematics with Proteus
  - Designing the board schematics with Eagle
  - Writing the CCS code to read the temperature and display it with seven segment displays
  - Writing a Java code to choose an alert temperature from a PC connected to the PIC with a Serial connector.
  - Managing and sending the data to and from the PIC - PC 
  - Display alert on PC with the Java interface if temperature is higher than the limit set
